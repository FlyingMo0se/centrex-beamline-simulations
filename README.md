# centrex-beamline-simulations
This repository contains files related to the beamline simulations done for the Cold nuclear time reversal experiment (CeNTREX) in the DeMille group at Yale University. The aim of the beamline simulations has been to study the effect of an electrostatic lens on the number of molecules that successfully propagate through the experiment from the cryogenic buffer gas beam source to the detection region.
